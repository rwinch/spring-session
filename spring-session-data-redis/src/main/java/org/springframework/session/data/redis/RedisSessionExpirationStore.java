/**
 * An interface for storing {@link RedisIndexedSessionRepository.RedisSession} instances
 * with their expected expiration time. This approach is necessary because Redis does not
 * guarantee when the expired event will be fired if the key has not been accessed. For
 * more details, see the Redis documentation on
 * <a href="https://redis.io/commands/expire/#:~:text=How%20Redis%20expires%20keys"> how
 * keys expire</a>. To address the uncertainty of expired events, sessions can be stored
 * with their expected expiration time, ensuring each key is accessed when it is expected
 * to expire. This interface defines common operations for tracking sessions and their
 * expiration times, and allows for a strategy to clean up expired sessions.
